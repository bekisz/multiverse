# alakka

Alakka is an artificial life simulation framework that helps to understand complex genetic phenomena.  

You can create your own genetic __Experiment__ by creating your own world, running it thousands or millions of times (with a possiblility to vary some input parameters) and then to analyze the possible outputs.   

Alakka is written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) on top of [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

Enjoy the experimentation.

## Examples

The best way to create your own experiment is to use one of these :

- [Galton-Watson Experiment](/org/montecarlo/examples/galtonwatson/README.md)
- ... more to come...
